# Create a list with 5 playersâ€™ names after that simulate 100 rounds for each player.
# As a result of the game create a list with the player's name and score (0-1000 range).
#And save it to a CSV file.

#The file should look like this:
#Player name, Score
# Josh, 56
# Luke, 784
# Kate, 90
# Mark, 125
# Mary, 877
# Josh, 345
